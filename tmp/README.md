# Temporary Scripts

This folder is for temporary/intermediate scripts created during development. Scripts here are ignored by Git and should
be deleted after use.

## Guidelines

- Place temporary test scripts here instead of in the main scripts/ folder
- Add descriptive names with dates if the script may be useful later
- Clean up when finished or document why it should be kept
- If a script becomes permanent, move it to scripts/ and add JSDoc
